### Policy

We follow the semantic versioning policy ([semver.org](http://semver.org/)) with a caveat:

> Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
>
>MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,<br/>
>MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and<br/>
>PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

**caveat**: Major version zero is a special case indicating development version that may make incompatible API changes without incrementing MAJOR version.
